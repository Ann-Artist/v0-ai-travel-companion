# üåç AI Travel Companion for the Differently-Abled

**Empowering blind and deaf travelers with accessible navigation, obstacle awareness, and communication support.**

---

## ‚ú® Project Overview
Traveling can be stressful for anyone, but for people who are blind, deaf, or have other disabilities, it can be even more challenging.  
Current navigation apps are not designed with their needs in mind, leaving major gaps in **accessibility, safety, and independence**.  

The **AI Travel Companion** is an **Android-based application** that provides **real-time navigation, obstacle detection, captions for announcements, and emergency assistance**.  

Unlike generic travel apps, this solution combines **voice guidance, vibration cues, captions, and SOS safety features** in one accessible system.

## üéØ Main Goals
- **Accessible Navigation**: Provide turn-by-turn navigation adapted for differently-abled users.  
- **Blind Mode**: Voice instructions (TTS) + vibration cues.  
- **Deaf Mode**: On-screen captions + visual alerts.  
- **Enhanced Safety**: One-tap SOS button to share live location with caregivers/family.  
- **Communication Support**: Speech-to-Text (STT) for real-time captions of public announcements.  
- **User-Centered Accessibility**: Large buttons, simple UI, haptic feedback, and switchable modes.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
1. **User chooses mode**: Blind Mode or Deaf Mode.  
2. **Navigation assistance**:  
   - Blind users ‚Üí Voice + vibration cues.  
   - Deaf users ‚Üí On-screen arrows + captions.  
3. **Obstacle detection (optional)**: Camera + AI model detects stairs, vehicles, or barriers.  
4. **Communication support**: STT converts announcements into captions (multilingual).  
5. **Emergency SOS**: One tap shares live location via SMS/Firebase to caregivers.

## üöÄ Future Enhancements
- Crowdsourced accessibility data (ramps, elevators, barriers).  
- Indoor navigation (airports, malls, metro stations).  
- Integration with wearables (smartwatches, smart canes, AR glasses).  
- AR captions for deaf users / AR arrows for navigation.  
- Indian Sign Language (ISL) support via gesture recognition.

## üìà Impact
- **Social**: Increases independence and dignity for differently-abled travelers.  
- **Economic**: Expands tourism opportunities and reduces reliance on costly human guides.  
- **Environmental**: Encourages sustainable travel (walking, public transport) through accessibility.  

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations (MVP)
- Depends on stable internet for real-time navigation and STT (offline support limited).  
- AI obstacle detection may struggle in low-light or crowded scenarios.  
- Battery intensive (camera + GPS + AR features).  
- Limited language coverage in MVP (focus on English + Hindi first).
